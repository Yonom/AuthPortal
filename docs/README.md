# AuthPortal

The simplest way to add Firebase Authentication to your website.  

AuthPortal is an Authorization Server for Firebase Authentication. Your App redirects users to AuthPortal, which performs the necessary steps to identify the user (e.g. ask for a username and password). This way, your app no longer needs to implement any user interfaces for login processes (login, signup, password reset, etc.).
